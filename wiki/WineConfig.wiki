#summary Wine config for Rapicker.

= Disable the GUI crash dialog =

As of 1.1.20, Wine includes a GUI crash dialog that is turned on by default. Users of apps that work despite a background crash may find the GUI dialog annoying, and in some cases the dialog itself has been reported to prevent an app from working. 
*This dialog stops the Ragpicker Process!*

The easiest way to disable the crash dialog is with winetricks:
{{{
sh winetricks nocrashdialog 
}}}
If you prefer to do it manually, copy the following key to a text editor:
{{{
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\WineDbg] 
"ShowCrashDialog"=dword:00000000 
}}}
Save the file with a .reg extension (e.g., crashdialog.reg), then apply it with regedit:
{{{
regedit crashdialog.reg 
}}}
These changes can also be made by simply running regedit and adding/changing the appropriate key the point-and-click way.

= Getting winetricks =
{{{
wget http://winetricks.org/winetricks
chmod +x winetricks 
}}}
