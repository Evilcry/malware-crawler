All crawler-plugins are and should be placed inside the folder at /crawler/.

## A basic crawler plugin could look like: ##
```python

import logging
from core.abstracts import Crawler

try:
from yapsy.IPlugin import IPlugin
except ImportError:
raise ImportError, 'Yapsy is required'

log = logging.getLogger("TestCrawler")

class Test(IPlugin, Crawler):

def run(self):
log.info("Fetching from localhost")
self.mapURL = {}

urls = self.options.get('url').split(',')

for url in urls:
log.info('URL=' + url)
self.storeURL(url)

return self.mapURL
```
