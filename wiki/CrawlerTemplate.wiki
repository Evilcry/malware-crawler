#summary A basic crawler template
#labels Phase-Implementation

All crawler-plugins are and should be placed inside the folder at /crawler/.

== A basic crawler plugin could look like: ==
<code language="python">
import logging
from core.abstracts import Crawler

try:
    from yapsy.IPlugin import IPlugin
except ImportError:
    raise ImportError, 'Yapsy is required'

log = logging.getLogger("TestCrawler")

class Test(IPlugin, Crawler):    
    
    def run(self):
        log.info("Fetching from localhost")
        self.mapURL = {}
        
        urls = self.options.get('url').split(',')
        
        for url in urls:
            log.info('URL=' + url)
            self.storeURL(url)          
            
        return self.mapURL
