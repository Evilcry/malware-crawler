All reporting-plugins are and should be placed inside the folder at /reporting/.

Every plugin should also have a dedicated section in the file config/reporting.conf: for this example if you create a module module/reporting/mymodul.py you will have to append the following section to config/processing.conf:

```
[hpfriends]
enabled = no
channel = ragpicker.reports
host = hpfriends.honeycloud.net
port = 20000
ident = my_ident
secret = my_secret
```

Every additional option you add to your section will be available to your processing plugin in the self.options dictionary.

## A basic reporting plugin could look like: ##
```python

import json
import logging
from core.abstracts import Report

try:
from yapsy.IPlugin import IPlugin
except ImportError:
raise ImportError, 'Yapsy (Yet Another Plugin System) is required to run this program : http://yapsy.sourceforge.net'

try:
import utils.hpfeeds as hpfeeds
except ImportError:
raise ImportError, 'Unable to import HPFeeds library: https://github.com/rep/hpfeeds'

log = logging.getLogger("ReportingHPFriends")

class HPFriends(IPlugin, Report):

def run(self, results, objfile):
host = self.options.get("host", "hpfriends.honeycloud.net")
port = self.options.get("port", 20000)
ident = self.options.get("ident")
secret = self.options.get("secret")
channel_reports = self.options.get("channel_reports")
channel_files = self.options.get("channel_files")

if not ident or not secret:
raise Exception("HPFriends Identifier and Secret not configurated")

try:
#Connect to HPFriends
hpc = hpfeeds.HPC(host, port, ident, secret, timeout=60)

if channel_reports:
#publish JSON-Report on the HPFriends channel
log.info("publish JSON-Report on the HPFriends channel %s" % channel_reports)
hpc.publish(channel_reports, json.dumps(results, default=self.date_handler, sort_keys=False, indent=4))

if channel_files:
#publish RAW-File as BASE64 on the HPFriends channel
log.info("publish BASE64 on the HPFriends channel %s" % channel_files)
hpc.publish(channel_files, json.dumps(objfile.get_fileB64encode(), sort_keys=False, indent=4))
except hpfeeds.FeedException as e:
raise Exception("publish on the channel failed: %s" % e)
finally:
hpc.close()
```
