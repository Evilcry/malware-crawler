#summary A basic processing template
#labels Phase-Implementation

All processing-plugins are and should be placed inside the folder at /processing/.

Every plugin should also have a dedicated section in the file config/processing.conf: for this example if you create a module module/reporting/mymodul.py you will have to append the following section to config/processing.conf:

{{{
[mymodul]
enabled = yes
test = 1234
}}}

Every additional option you add to your section will be available to your processing plugin in the self.options dictionary.

== A basic processing plugin could look like: ==
<code language="python">
import logging
from core.abstracts import Processing

try:
    from yapsy.IPlugin import IPlugin
except ImportError:
    raise ImportError, 'Yapsy is required'

log = logging.getLogger("ProcessingMyModule")

class MyModule(IPlugin, Processing):
    
    def run(self, cls_file):
        self.key = "MyKey"
        self.score = -1
        test = self.options.get("test", None)

         data = do_something()
        
        return data
</code>

Every processing module should contain:
  * A run() function.
  * A self.key attribute defining the name to be used as a subcontainer for the returned data.
  * A self.score attribute what the risk level determines (The value "-1" disabled this function)
  * A set of data (list, dictionary or string etc.) that will be appended to the global container.
