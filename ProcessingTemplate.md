All processing-plugins are and should be placed inside the folder at /processing/.

Every plugin should also have a dedicated section in the file config/processing.conf: for this example if you create a module module/reporting/mymodul.py you will have to append the following section to config/processing.conf:

```
[mymodul]
enabled = yes
test = 1234
```

Every additional option you add to your section will be available to your processing plugin in the self.options dictionary.

## A basic processing plugin could look like: ##
```python

import logging
from core.abstracts import Processing

try:
from yapsy.IPlugin import IPlugin
except ImportError:
raise ImportError, 'Yapsy is required'

log = logging.getLogger("ProcessingMyModule")

class MyModule(IPlugin, Processing):

def run(self, cls_file):
self.key = "MyKey"
self.score = -1
test = self.options.get("test", None)

data = do_something()

return data
```

Every processing module should contain:
  * A run() function.
  * A self.key attribute defining the name to be used as a subcontainer for the returned data.
  * A self.score attribute what the risk level determines (The value "-1" disabled this function)
  * A set of data (list, dictionary or string etc.) that will be appended to the global container.
