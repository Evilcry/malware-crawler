# Disable the GUI crash dialog #

As of 1.1.20, Wine includes a GUI crash dialog that is turned on by default. Users of apps that work despite a background crash may find the GUI dialog annoying, and in some cases the dialog itself has been reported to prevent an app from working.
**This dialog stops the Ragpicker Process!**

The easiest way to disable the crash dialog is with winetricks:
```
sh winetricks nocrashdialog 
```
If you prefer to do it manually, copy the following key to a text editor:
```
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\WineDbg] 
"ShowCrashDialog"=dword:00000000 
```
Save the file with a .reg extension (e.g., crashdialog.reg), then apply it with regedit:
```
regedit crashdialog.reg 
```
These changes can also be made by simply running regedit and adding/changing the appropriate key the point-and-click way.

# Getting winetricks #
```
wget http://winetricks.org/winetricks
chmod +x winetricks 
```
